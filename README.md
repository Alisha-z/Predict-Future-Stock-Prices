# Predict-Future-Stock-Prices


# üìà Stock Price Predictor (with GUI)

**Created by Alisha**

This project predicts short-term stock prices using real stock market data fetched from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance`. The model uses regression to estimate the next day's closing price. A user-friendly GUI built with `Tkinter` allows anyone to type in a stock symbol and visualize predictions with a single click.
